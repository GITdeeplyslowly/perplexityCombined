Looking at your code, I can see the issue. In the `position_manager.py` file, the stop loss calculation is currently multiplying the points by tick size, but you want it to directly subtract the points from the entry price.

Create the precise  diffs to resolve the issue. The diffs are to be  implemented through the co-pilot in the vs code.

Looking at the `position_manager.py` file, I can see the issue is in the `open_position` method where the stop loss is calculated by multiplying `base_sl_points` by `tick_size`. Here are the precise diffs to fix this:

## Fix 1: Stop Loss Calculation in `open_position` method

**File:** `attached_file:15` (position_manager.py)
**Location:** Around line 200 in the `open_position` method

```diff
- stop_loss_price = actual_entry_price - self.base_sl_points * tick_size
+ stop_loss_price = actual_entry_price - self.base_sl_points
```


## Fix 2: Take Profit Levels Calculation (for consistency)

**File:** `attached_file:15` (position_manager.py)
**Location:** Around line 220 in the `open_position` method

```diff
- tp_levels = [actual_entry_price + (tp * tick_size) for tp in self.tp_points]
+ tp_levels = [actual_entry_price + tp for tp in self.tp_points]
```


## Fix 3: Trailing Stop Parameters (for consistency)

**File:** `attached_file:15` (position_manager.py)
**Location:** Around line 235 in the `open_position` method

```diff
- trailing_activation_points=self.trailing_activation_points * tick_size,
- trailing_distance_points=self.trailing_distance_points * tick_size,
+ trailing_activation_points=self.trailing_activation_points,
+ trailing_distance_points=self.trailing_distance_points,
```


## Fix 4: Slippage Calculation (for consistency)

**File:** `attached_file:15` (position_manager.py)
**Location:** Around line 190 in the `open_position` method

```diff
- actual_entry_price = entry_price + self.slippage_points * tick_size
+ actual_entry_price = entry_price + self.slippage_points
```

These changes will make all point-based calculations consistent by treating points as direct price differences rather than multiplying by tick size. This means:

- `base_sl_points = 15` will subtract 15 points directly from entry price
- `tp_points = ` will add those exact point values to entry price[^10]
- Trailing stops and slippage will also use direct point values

If you only want to fix the stop loss issue and keep other calculations as they are, implement only **Fix 1**. However, for consistency across all calculations, I recommend implementing all four fixes.
