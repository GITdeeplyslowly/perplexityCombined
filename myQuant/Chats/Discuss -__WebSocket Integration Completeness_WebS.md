WebSocket Integration Completeness
WebSocket streamer exists but integration with main workflow needs verification
Fallback mechanisms when WebSocket fails

The WebSocket integration provides a high‐throughput, event-driven tick feed, but its end-to-end reliability depends on clear fallback paths and seamless handoff into the trading workflow. Here’s the current status and recommendations:

1. WebSocketTickStreamer Core
    - Implements robust reconnect logic in `start_stream()`, retrying on disconnects with exponential backoff.
    - On each incoming message, it parses JSON and calls the registered `on_tick` callback. Parsing errors are logged as errors but the stream continues.[^1]
2. Handoff into BrokerAdapter
    - In live mode, `trader.py` instantiates `BrokerAdapter`, which in turn either attaches the WebSocket streamer or falls back to polling if `SmartWebSocketV2` is unavailable.[^2]
    - The adapter’s constructor checks for a valid frozen config and raises immediately if missing (fail-fast on config), then attempts to start streaming.
3. Polling Fallback Mechanism
    - If the WebSocket client fails to import or connect, `BrokerAdapter` catches the `ImportError` or connection exception, logs an error, and switches to REST polling at configurable intervals (from `defaults.py`).
    - Polling uses the same `get_next_tick()` method, ensuring downstream code sees identical tick objects whether via WS or polling.
4. Integration in Trader Loop
    - `trader.py`’s main loop calls `broker_adapter.get_next_tick()`.
– When streaming, this returns the next buffered tick from WebSocket.
– When polling, it fetches LTP on demand.
    - Missing ticks or temporary WS disconnects simply return `None`, which the loop skips without halting trading.
5. Verification Gaps
    - **Health Checks**: There is no periodic health-check callback to monitor stream latency or message gap size.
    - **Auto-Switch Controls**: While the adapter falls back on initial import/connect failure, it doesn’t auto-switch if the stream drops after a period of stability.
    - **GUI Visibility**: The GUI does not display stream status (connected vs. polling), leaving the user unaware of degraded feed.
6. Recommendations
    - Implement a **heartbeat monitor** that tracks the time since the last tick; if it exceeds a threshold, trigger an automatic fallback to polling and log a warning.
    - Expose a **stream status flag** in the GUI—green when WS is active, yellow when polling, red on repeated failures.
    - Add a **recovery routine**: after fallback, periodically attempt to reconnect the WebSocket in the background, and switch back when available.

With these enhancements, the WebSocket integration will be truly complete: always-on, self-healing, and transparent to both the trading engine and the user.
