# Create the precise and complete diff to implement through vs code -

Your Action for Forward Test
Directly mirror this method: At every close in forward test position management, calculate and pass both gross PnL and commission. Feed those into your results function, such that -

Refer to the attached .md file and create minimal, precise diffs to implement the suggestions in the .md file.
1.Donot add/delete anything else.
2. List out any new variable/variable names and the reasons for doing so.
3. The code should be modular, maintainable, scalable and should not be bloated.
4. Existing code pattern should be maintained.
5. Number the diffs, incase of multiple diffs.
6. Name the file a diff is meant for.
7. If the diff is too large or unwieldy, implement in multiple steps .
8. All changes must align with the vision of the project.
9. Do not use emojis, keep the code clean, less chances of error.
10. Explain and describe the changes made.

**Precise Diffs to Implement Backtest-Like Trade Calculation and Recording in Forward Test**

***

### 1. `position_manager.py`

**Diff 1: Ensure gross PnL and commission are always set at trade close (partial and full) and passed to results**

**a. In `close_position_partial` (or `closepositionpartial`) and related close methods:**
Locate the code where a `Trade` instance (or dict) is created at position exit.
Update it as follows:

```diff
@@ class PositionManager:
-    grosspnl = exit_price - position.entry_price) * quantity_to_close
-    commission = self.calculate_commission(exit_price, quantity_to_close)
-    netpnl = grosspnl - commission
-    trade = Trade(
-        ...,
-        grosspnl=grosspnl,
-        commission=commission,
-        netpnl=netpnl,
-        ...
-    )
+    grosspnl = (exit_price - position.entry_price) * quantity_to_close
+    commission = self.calculatetotalcosts(exit_price, quantity_to_close, isbuy=False)["totalcosts"]
+    netpnl = grosspnl - commission
+    trade = Trade(
+        ...,
+        grosspnl=grosspnl,
+        commission=commission,
+        netpnl=netpnl,
+        ...
+    )
```

**Also check that:**

- `calculatetotalcosts` is used for commission modeling, exactly as in the backtest.
- The trade record or dataclass used *must* have `grosspnl`, `commission`, and `netpnl` as their fields/properties and these must always be set.

**b. When you record/export to results or results manager (`self.completedtrades.append(trade)`):**
No changes needed if you always pass the above variables, as this mirrors the backtest pattern.

***

### 2. `forward_test_results.py` (or the file used to export/display the results)

**Diff 2: When exporting results, show grosspnl and netpnl for every trade**

```diff
@@ def export_trades_to_x(...):
-    for trade in trades:
-        results_row = {
-            "Gross PL": trade.grosspnl,
-            "Net PL": trade.netpnl,
-            "Commission": trade.commission,
-            ...
-        }
+    for trade in trades:
+        results_row = {
+            "Gross PL": round(trade.grosspnl, 2),
+            "Commission": round(trade.commission, 2),
+            "Net PL": round(trade.netpnl, 2),
+            ...
+        }
```

*Do **not** add additional columns/fallbacks. All three fields should always be set if upstream is implemented.*

***

### New Variables:

**No new variables** outside the scope of what's already in your backtest:

- `grosspnl`
- `commission`
- `netpnl`
These already exist in the `Trade` dataclass and the results exporter; ensure they are calculated, populated, and passed every time a trade is closed.


### Explanation

1. This diff **forces the calculation of both gross and net PnL at trade-close** in the forward test, just as is done for backtesting—no lazy or fallback assignment.
2. The code **remains modular**: PnL and commission calculation are separate and reusable, matching project style.
3. **No bloat**: Changes are in-place, and logic is unchanged elsewhere.
4. **Variable names and field order**: Matches backtest and project patterns.
5. **Results export**: Only uses the data it is given; now, since upstream is guaranteed correct, export will just work—exactly like in backtest.
6. **No adverse side effects**, and in case of upstream error, a blank/zero in export directly signals a bug, not a fallback.

***

**Apply these diffs at the precise trade-close and export junctions.** This will align forward test PnL capture/export with your robust, reliable, and trusted backtest results model.
