# The gross pnl amount on top is not appearing in center, should be in column D and E. The amount is not in the same row, now colour, red for - and green for +.

To have the **Gross P\&L Total (label and value) appear centered in columns D and E** (so the label is in D1, the value is in E1), and keep both of them in the *same row* (no extra columns or rows), with the *amount* cell dynamically colored (green for profit, red for loss), you should:

### 1. Write the label and amount in the D1 and E1 cells.

### 2. Format (center, bold, color) those two specific cells only.

### 3. Ensure the rest of the export logic writes data starting below these header cells (from row 3).


***

Here's the **precise block** to use after you write your data with pandas and load with openpyxl:

```python
from openpyxl.styles import Font, Alignment, PatternFill

# Set label and value in D1 and E1
ws['D1'] = 'Gross P&L Total'
ws['E1'] = gross_pnl_total

# Style D1 (label)
ws['D1'].font = Font(size=20, bold=True)
ws['D1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal="center", vertical="center")

# Style E1 (value, colored)
ws['E1'].font = Font(size=25, bold=True)
ws['E1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal="center", vertical="center")
if gross_pnl_total >= 0:
    ws['E1'].fill = PatternFill(start_color="C6EFCE", end_color="C6EFCE", fill_type="solid")  # Green
else:
    ws['E1'].fill = PatternFill(start_color="FFC7CE", end_color="FFC7CE", fill_type="solid")  # Red
```

**You should NOT write pandas DataFrames over rows 1 and 2**—make sure your config and other tables start at row 3 or later (e.g. `startrow=2` for pandas ExcelWriter).

***

### **Summary of steps (complete):**

1. In your `export_to_excel` method, after saving with pandas but before further formatting:
    - Set ws['D1'] and ws['E1'] as shown above.
    - Format D1/E1 per above.
2. When writing the config and trade DataFrames to Excel, ensure `startrow=2` (row 3 in Excel) to avoid overwriting.
3. Rest of logic (column adjustments, format, wrap, split trades) stays as you already have.

***

**Result:**

- Your file will have `"Gross P&L Total"` label in *D1* and the amount in *E1*, colored depending on profit/loss, both bold and centered.
- Config, indicators, and trade tables will appear beneath (starting row 3).
- Works with Google Sheets and Excel.

***

**If you want the amount formatted with thousands grouping and decimals:**

```python
ws['E1'] = f"{gross_pnl_total:,.2f}"
```


***

This guarantees the result you requested: label and value side by side in the center of the sheet (columns D/E, row 1), on the same row, and the value color-coded for profit or loss.
