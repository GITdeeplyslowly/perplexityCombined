# GUI Freeze Fix - File Simulation Callback Mode

## Problem Report
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**User Report:** GUI and logs froze after changing green tick requirement from 5 to 3

## Root Cause Analysis

### Symptoms
- Forward test started successfully
- First position opened (baab5a23 at â‚¹226.20)
- GUI completely froze - no updates, no logs
- 32,591 data points loaded but GUI unresponsive

### Technical Analysis
1. **File simulation callback mode** processes ticks synchronously via polling
2. **No delay** between tick processing - CPU-bound tight loop
3. Python's **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** prevented GUI thread from executing
4. Background thread processing **32,591 ticks at maximum CPU speed**
5. GUI thread starved of CPU time, appearing frozen

### Code Flow
```python
# BEFORE FIX: CPU-saturating loop
def _run_file_simulation_callback_mode(self):
    while self.is_running:
        tick = self.broker.get_next_tick()
        if tick:
            self._on_tick_direct(tick, "FILE_SIM")  # Process immediately
            # NO DELAY - next tick processed immediately
            # GIL prevents GUI thread from running
```

## Solution

### Implementation
Added `time.sleep(0.001)` (1ms) between each tick to:
1. **Yield to GUI thread** - Allows GUI updates to process
2. **Simulate realistic timing** - ~1000 ticks/second max (still very fast)
3. **Prevent GIL saturation** - Background thread releases GIL during sleep
4. **Maintain responsiveness** - GUI remains interactive during simulation

### Fixed Code
```python
# AFTER FIX: GUI-friendly loop
def _run_file_simulation_callback_mode(self):
    while self.is_running:
        tick = self.broker.get_next_tick()
        if tick:
            self._on_tick_direct(tick, "FILE_SIM")
            
            # CRITICAL: Yield to GUI thread to prevent freezing
            time.sleep(0.001)  # 1ms delay = ~1000 ticks/sec max
```

## Performance Impact

### File Simulation (Fixed)
- **Before:** ~30K+ ticks/second (CPU bound, GUI frozen)
- **After:** ~1000 ticks/second max (GUI responsive)
- **Trade-off:** Simulation takes ~32 seconds instead of <1 second
- **Benefit:** GUI remains fully responsive, logs update in real-time

### Live WebSocket Trading (Untouched)
- **No impact** - Live WebSocket path completely separate
- Ticks arrive at natural market rate (~50-200ms between ticks)
- No artificial delays added to live trading
- **Sacrosanct performance preserved** âœ…

## Comparison with Polling Mode

### Polling Mode
- Already has natural delays:
  - `time.sleep(0.05)` when waiting for WebSocket ticks
  - `time.sleep(1.0)` in polling mode
  - `time.sleep(0.001)` every 100 ticks for GUI yield
- File simulation naturally slower due to polling overhead

### Callback Mode (File Simulation)
- Was processing ticks at maximum speed
- Now matches realistic tick rates
- Both modes now GUI-friendly

## Validation

### Expected Behavior After Fix
âœ… GUI remains responsive during file simulation  
âœ… Logs update every 1000 ticks (progress visible)  
âœ… Performance summary updates every 50 ticks  
âœ… Stop button works immediately  
âœ… Simulation completes in ~32 seconds (32K ticks @ ~1K/sec)  
âœ… Results export successfully at completion  

### Live Trading Unaffected
âœ… Live WebSocket path has zero changes  
âœ… No delays added to live tick processing  
âœ… Callback handler remains pristine  
âœ… ~50ms latency preserved  

## Key Lessons

1. **CPU-bound loops in GUI applications** need explicit yielding
2. **Python's GIL** can starve threads without sleep/IO operations
3. **File simulation** should mimic realistic timing, not max speed
4. **Separation of concerns** critical - live path untouched
5. **Small delays** (1ms) have huge impact on GUI responsiveness

## Files Modified

### trader.py
- **Location:** `myQuant/live/trader.py`
- **Method:** `_run_file_simulation_callback_mode()`
- **Change:** Added `time.sleep(0.001)` after each tick processing
- **Lines:** ~387 (added after performance callback)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **File Simulation Test:**
   - Run with 32K+ data points
   - Verify GUI updates continuously
   - Check logs appear in real-time
   - Confirm stop button works

2. **Live WebSocket Test:**
   - Verify no performance degradation
   - Confirm ~50ms latency maintained
   - Test for several hours for stability

3. **Performance Comparison:**
   - Measure callback mode vs polling mode
   - Monitor CPU usage (should be lower now)
   - Check memory stability over time

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Ready for testing  
ðŸ“… **Date:** October 14, 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Version:** File simulation callback mode v1.1
