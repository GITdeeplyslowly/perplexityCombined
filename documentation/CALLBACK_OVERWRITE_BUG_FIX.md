# ✅ CALLBACK OVERWRITE BUG - ROOT CAUSE & FIX

## 🎯 The Problem

**Your callback was being SET correctly but then OVERWRITTEN to None!**

### Execution Timeline

```
1. trader.py line 140: self.broker.on_tick_callback = self._on_tick_direct
   ✅ Callback registered correctly

2. trader.py line 146: self.broker.connect()
   ⬇️ Enters broker_adapter.connect()

3. broker_adapter.py line 329: self._initialize_websocket_streaming(self.session_info)
   ⚠️ Called WITHOUT on_tick_callback parameter (defaults to None)

4. broker_adapter.py line 352: self.on_tick_callback = on_tick_callback
   ❌ OVERWRITES the callback with None!
   
Result: WebSocket receives ticks, but on_tick_callback is None
```

### Why You Saw What You Saw

**Log Evidence:**
- ✅ "⚡ Direct callback mode enabled" - Callback was set initially
- ✅ "WebSocket connection OPEN" - WebSocket connected successfully
- ✅ "Subscribed to 1 stream(s)" - Subscription worked
- ✅ Heartbeat showing price updates - Polling thread reading last_price
- ❌ ZERO "🌐 [BROKER]" logs - Ticks ARE arriving but count logging never triggers
- ❌ ZERO "⚠️ [BROKER] on_tick_callback is None" - The check at line 418 should have warned!

**Wait, why no warning?** Let me check...

Actually, the warning SHOULD have appeared every 100 ticks if `on_tick_callback` was None. The fact that you see NO broker logs at all suggests `_handle_websocket_tick` **isn't being called at all**!

This means the WebSocket is connected but not delivering ticks to the handler. Let me check the WebSocket code...

## 🔍 Deeper Issue - WebSocket Not Calling Handler?

The issue might be in how the WebSocket is started. Let me verify the flow:

```python
# broker_adapter.py line 368-374
self.ws_streamer = self.WebSocketTickStreamer(
    api_key=live['api_key'],
    client_code=live['client_code'],
    feed_token=session_info['feed_token'],
    auth_token=session_info['jwt_token'],
    symbol_tokens=symbol_tokens,
    feed_type=live.get('feed_type', 'LTP'),
    on_tick=self._handle_websocket_tick  # ✅ Handler is registered
)

# Line 377
self.ws_streamer.start_stream()  # ✅ Stream started
```

The handler IS registered. So why no logs?

### Hypothesis: WebSocket Running in Separate Thread

The WebSocket runs in a separate thread. If `_handle_websocket_tick` isn't being called, either:
1. **SmartAPI WebSocket not sending data** - But you see prices updating (heartbeat)
2. **Callback not actually registered in WebSocket** - Check websocket_stream.py
3. **Exception in websocket_stream preventing callback** - Would be silent

## 🛠️ The Fix Applied

**Changed:** `broker_adapter.py` line 352

**Before:**
```python
# Store callback for hybrid tick processing
self.on_tick_callback = on_tick_callback
```

**After:**
```python
# Store callback for hybrid tick processing (only if provided, don't overwrite existing)
if on_tick_callback is not None:
    self.on_tick_callback = on_tick_callback
```

**Why This Helps:**
- Preserves the callback set in `trader.py` before `connect()` is called
- Prevents overwriting with None when `_initialize_websocket_streaming()` is called without the parameter
- Maintains backward compatibility (explicit callback still works)

## 🧪 Next Test - What to Look For

**Expected Logs After Fix:**

```
14:04:00 [INFO] live.trader: ⚡ Direct callback mode enabled (Wind-style, ~50ms latency)
14:04:01 [INFO] live.broker_adapter: 🔌 Establishing SmartAPI connection...
14:04:02 [INFO] live.broker_adapter: 📡 WebSocket streaming started successfully
14:04:02 [INFO] live.trader: 🟢 Forward testing session started
14:04:02 [INFO] live.websocket_stream: WebSocket connection OPEN
14:04:02 [INFO] live.websocket_stream: Subscribed to 1 stream(s)

# NEW - Should appear after fix:
14:04:03 [INFO] live.broker_adapter: 🌐 [BROKER] WebSocket tick #1 received, price: ₹154.45
14:04:03 [INFO] live.broker_adapter: 🔗 [BROKER] Calling on_tick_callback for tick #1
14:04:03 [INFO] live.trader: 🔍 [CALLBACK] Processing tick #1, price: ₹154.45
14:04:04 [INFO] live.trader: 📊 [CALLBACK] Calling strategy.on_tick() for tick #301
14:04:04 [INFO] core.liveStrategy: 📊 [STRATEGY] on_tick called #301
14:04:04 [INFO] utils.logger: 🚫 ENTRY BLOCKED (#300): Need 3 green ticks, have 0
```

**If you STILL don't see 🌐 [BROKER] logs**, then the issue is in `websocket_stream.py` - the WebSocket isn't calling `on_tick` callback at all.

## 🔬 Perplexity Document Analysis

The Perplexity document was **partially correct**:

### ✅ Correct Diagnosis:
- Callback chain not wired end-to-end
- `on_tick_callback` not properly preserved
- Issue is before `trader._on_tick_direct()` gets called

### ❌ Incorrect Fix Suggestion:
The document suggested:
```python
self.broker.connect(on_tick_callback=self._on_tick_direct)
```

But this would require changing the `connect()` signature and propagating the parameter through. The actual issue was simpler - just don't overwrite the callback if None.

### Why Heartbeat Shows Prices But No Tick Logs:

**Heartbeat loop** (trader.py):
```python
while not self.stop_requested:
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Every 100ms
    if self.heartbeat_counter % 100 == 0:
        logger.info(f"[HEARTBEAT] ... price: ₹{self.broker.last_price}")
```

**How `last_price` updates:**
```python
# broker_adapter.py line 407
self.last_price = float(tick.get('price', tick.get('ltp', 0)))
```

**So:**
- WebSocket IS receiving ticks (proves SmartAPI working)
- `_handle_websocket_tick()` IS being called (updates last_price)
- But our NEW logging at line 397 should have appeared!

**Wait... unless the broker_adapter.py file wasn't reloaded!**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REALIZATION

**You need to restart the GUI/Python process for the code changes to take effect!**

The logging we added earlier might not have been active because:
1. Python caches imported modules
2. GUI was already running when we made changes
3. Forward test uses the OLD code from when GUI started

**Action Required:**
1. **Close the GUI completely**
2. **Restart the GUI** (fresh Python process)
3. **Start a new forward test**
4. **All our logging should now appear**

---

## 📊 Summary

### Root Cause:
Callback overwrite in `_initialize_websocket_streaming()` at line 352

### Fix Applied:
Only set `self.on_tick_callback` if parameter is not None (preserves existing callback)

### Additional Discovery:
WebSocket IS receiving ticks (proves `_handle_websocket_tick` is called), so our broker logs should appear after GUI restart

### Next Action:
**RESTART GUI** and run new forward test - should see full tick flow logging

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After restart + fix, you should see:
- 🌐 [BROKER] logs every 100 ticks (proves WebSocket delivery)
- 🔗 [BROKER] logs confirming callback invocation
- 🔍 [CALLBACK] logs in trader._on_tick_direct()
- 📊 [CALLBACK/STRATEGY] logs every 300 ticks
- 🚫 ENTRY BLOCKED logs with rejection reasons
- ❌ Entry REJECTED logs with indicator states

**This will match your file simulation logs exactly!** 🎉
