# Live WebStream Data Setup Guide

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: SmartAPI Connection Fixed

The system is now configured to use the real SmartAPI credentials from the angelalgo `.env.trading` file.

## Credential Source Configuration

### ✅ Using angelalgo Credentials
The system now automatically loads credentials from:
```
C:\Users\user\projects\angelalgo\.env.trading
```

**Variable Mapping:**
- `API_KEY` → SmartAPI API Key
- `CLIENT_ID` → SmartAPI Client Code  
- `PASSWORD` → SmartAPI PIN
- `SMARTAPI_TOTP_SECRET` → SmartAPI TOTP Token

### ✅ Automatic Fallback
If angelalgo file is not available, it falls back to:
```
C:\Users\user\projects\Perplexity Combined\myQuant\.env
```

## How to Use Live WebStream Data

### 1. ✅ Credentials Already Configured
Your SmartAPI credentials are automatically loaded from angelalgo.

### 2. Run Forward Test
- Start the GUI: `python gui/noCamel1.py`
- Make sure "Enable File Simulation" is **unchecked**  
- Click "Run Forward Test"
- The system will use **live WebStream data** from SmartAPI

## Current Status

✅ SmartAPI package installed and working  
✅ Authentication system configured  
✅ Environment variable support added  
✅ Broker adapter connects successfully  
✅ Paper trading mode enabled for safety
