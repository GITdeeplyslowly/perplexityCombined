"""
Test the race condition fix for green tick validation.

This test simulates the exact sequence that was causing the bug:
1. Strategy receives tick and updates green count
2. Strategy checks entry conditions 
3. If conditions pass, strategy generates BUY signal
4. Trader processes signal and executes entry

The bug was: Trader was doing a second entry check AFTER the green count was already updated,
creating a race condition.

Fix: Remove redundant entry check in trader since strategy already validated.
