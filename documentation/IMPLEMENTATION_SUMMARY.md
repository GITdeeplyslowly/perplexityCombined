# WebSocket Enhancement Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**File Modified:** `live/broker_adapter.py`  
**Total Changes:** 6 Diffs

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented three critical WebSocket enhancements to improve reliability and eliminate dual-source conflicts:

1. **Disable Polling Completely in WebSocket Mode**
2. **Add WebSocket Health Monitoring**
3. **Implement Smart Reconnection with Exponential Backoff**

---

## Diff 1: Add Smart Reconnection Instance Variables

**Location:** `__init__` method (lines ~97-103)

**New Variables Added:**
- `self.reconnect_backoff = 1.0` - Current backoff duration for exponential retry (starts at 1 second)
- `self.max_reconnect_backoff = 60.0` - Maximum backoff cap to prevent infinite delays (60 seconds)
- `self.reconnect_in_progress = False` - Thread-safe flag to prevent overlapping reconnection attempts

**Purpose:**
- Provides foundation for smart reconnection logic
- Enables exponential backoff strategy to prevent reconnection storms
- Prevents duplicate reconnection attempts from running concurrently

---

## Diff 2: Disable Polling Completely in WebSocket Mode

**Location:** `get_next_tick()` method (lines ~203-226)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed entire SmartAPI polling logic (40+ lines of code removed)
- WebSocket mode now returns `None` when buffer is empty instead of falling back to polling
- Eliminated rate limiting checks for polling mode when WebSocket is active
- Removed dual-source conflict that was causing tick stream interruptions

**Previous Behavior:**
```python
# Priority 2: SmartAPI polling mode (ONLY if WebSocket unavailable)
if not self.connection:
    logger.error("No SmartAPI connection available")
    return None

# Rate limiting for polling mode
current_time = time.time()
if self.last_poll_time and (current_time - self.last_poll_time) < self.min_poll_interval:
    return None

# ... 30+ lines of polling logic ...
```

**New Behavior:**
```python
# PURE WebSocket Mode - NO POLLING when WebSocket is active
if not self.connection:
    logger.error("No SmartAPI connection available")
    return None

# If we reach here, WebSocket is disabled - no fallback polling
logger.warning("WebSocket inactive and polling disabled - no data available")
return None
```

**Impact:**
- Eliminates API rate limiting issues caused by simultaneous WebSocket + polling
- Cleaner separation of concerns (WebSocket-only mode)
- Health monitoring system handles reconnections instead of falling back to polling

---

## Diff 3: Add WebSocket Health Monitoring Methods

**Location:** After `_handle_websocket_tick()` method (new methods added)

**New Methods Added:**

### `_start_health_monitoring()`
- Starts background daemon thread for health monitoring
- Only starts if thread doesn't exist or previous thread terminated
- Sets `_stop_monitoring = False` for clean lifecycle management

### `_health_monitor_loop()`
- Background monitoring loop running every 10 seconds
- Checks WebSocket health while `streaming_mode` is active
- Gracefully exits when `_stop_monitoring` flag is set
- Includes error recovery with 5-second pause on exceptions

### `_check_websocket_health()`
- Monitors silence duration since last tick
- Compares against `heartbeat_threshold` (30 seconds)
- Triggers smart reconnection when threshold exceeded
- Only active when `streaming_mode` is True and ticks have been received

**Key Features:**
- Non-blocking: Runs in background daemon thread
- Self-healing: Automatically detects and fixes silent connections
- Resource-efficient: 10-second check interval balances responsiveness vs CPU usage
- Thread-safe: Uses existing `tick_lock` for shared resource access

---

## Diff 4: Implement Smart Reconnection with Exponential Backoff

**Location:** After `_check_websocket_health()` method (new methods added)

**New Methods Added:**

### `_trigger_smart_reconnection()`
- Implements exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s (capped)
- Prevents overlapping reconnection attempts via `reconnect_in_progress` flag
- Enforces maximum reconnection attempts (3 attempts)
- Stops existing WebSocket before reconnection
- Refreshes authentication token
- Reinitializes WebSocket streaming
- Resets backoff on successful reconnection
- Doubles backoff on failure (up to max)

**Reconnection Flow:**
1. Check if reconnection already in progress (skip if true)
2. Check if max attempts reached (disable WebSocket if true)
3. Wait with exponential backoff
4. Stop existing WebSocket connection
5. Refresh session token
6. Reinitialize WebSocket
7. On success: reset backoff to 1.0s
8. On failure: double backoff (up to 60s max)

### `_refresh_session_token()`
- Attempts to reload existing session from disk first
- Falls back to fresh login if no valid session exists
- Gracefully handles refresh failures with warning log
- Updates `self.session_info` for reconnection use

**Key Features:**
- Exponential backoff prevents API abuse and reconnection storms
- Maximum attempt limit prevents infinite retry loops
- Token refresh ensures valid credentials for reconnection
- Clean error handling with detailed logging at each step

---

## Diff 5: Update _handle_websocket_tick to Reset Backoff

**Location:** `_handle_websocket_tick()` method (lines ~395-401)

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Reset reconnection backoff on successful tick
if self.reconnect_attempts > 0:
    logger.info("WebSocket tick received - resetting reconnection backoff")
    self.reconnect_attempts = 0
    self.reconnect_backoff = 1.0
```

**Purpose:**
- Detects successful reconnection when ticks resume
- Resets backoff timer to initial 1-second value
- Resets attempt counter to allow fresh reconnection cycle if needed
- Provides positive feedback that connection is healthy

---

## Diff 6: Start Health Monitoring After WebSocket Initialization

**Location:** `_initialize_websocket_streaming()` method (lines ~363-366)

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Start health monitoring for WebSocket
self._start_health_monitoring()
```

**Purpose:**
- Automatically starts health monitoring when WebSocket successfully initializes
- Ensures monitoring begins immediately after streaming starts
- No manual intervention required

---

## Diff 7: Add Health Monitoring Cleanup in disconnect()

**Location:** `disconnect()` method (line ~289)

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Stop health monitoring
self._stop_monitoring = True
```

**Purpose:**
- Gracefully terminates health monitoring thread
- Prevents resource leaks
- Ensures clean shutdown of background processes

---

|----------|------|---------|---------------|
| `reconnect_backoff` | float | Current exponential backoff duration | 1.0 seconds |

## Deviations from .md File Suggestions

### Minor Adjustments:

1. **`_refresh_session_token()` Implementation**
   - **Suggested**: Call `session_manager.refresh_session()`
   - **Implemented**: First try `load_session()`, fallback to `login()`
   - **Reason**: `refresh_session()` method doesn't exist in `SmartAPISessionManager`
   - **Impact**: None - achieved same goal using existing methods

2. **Emoji Usage in Logging**
   - **Suggested**: No emojis
   - **Implemented**: Removed from new code, but existing code has emojis
   - **Reason**: Maintaining consistency with existing codebase patterns
   - **Note**: Can remove all emojis project-wide if desired

3. **Emergency Polling Method**
   - **Suggested**: Create `_poll_smartapi_emergency()` stub method
   - **Implemented**: Removed polling entirely, no stub created
   - **Reason**: Cleaner to eliminate polling completely rather than create unused method
   - **Impact**: None - method would never be called

### No Other Deviations:
- All three core features implemented exactly as specified
- All variable names match suggestions
- All method signatures match suggestions
- All logic flows match suggestions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Health Monitoring Test**
   - Verify monitoring starts after WebSocket initialization
   - Confirm 10-second check interval
   - Test reconnection trigger when silence exceeds 30s

2. **Smart Reconnection Test**
   - Force WebSocket disconnection
   - Observe exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, 60s
   - Verify max 3 attempts before disabling
   - Confirm token refresh before each attempt

3. **Backoff Reset Test**
   - Trigger reconnection
   - Wait for successful tick
   - Verify backoff resets to 1.0s
   - Verify attempt counter resets to 0

4. **Cleanup Test**
   - Start system with WebSocket
   - Call disconnect()
   - Verify monitoring thread terminates
   - Check for resource leaks
