# The config information in the merged cell is truncated, the cell size should flexible and change according to the size of the config info.

To ensure the **merged cell size for config info is flexible and never truncates content** in Excel output, do the following in your `forward_test_results.py`:

***

## Diff/Code Instructions

**1. Dynamically Set Merge Range Based on Content Length**

Replace the static merge range logic (e.g., fixed rows/columns for the merged cell) with something that computes the needed row span based on the length of `config_text`.

Add this just before you merge and write the cell:

```python
from openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter
from openpyxl.styles import Alignment

config_text = self.generateconfigtext()  # Your config block text

# Estimate number of lines/rows needed (more robust if config_text contains actual \n line breaks)
lines = config_text.count('\n') + 1
base_row = 5
base_col = 2  # typically column B
col_span = 6  # e.g., B-G (adjust as desired)

extra_rows = max(10, lines // 2)  # heuristically, 2 lines per row, minimum 10 rows for aesthetics

# Compute end_row
end_row = base_row + extra_rows
end_col = base_col + col_span - 1

start_cell = f"{get_column_letter(base_col)}{base_row}"
end_cell = f"{get_column_letter(end_col)}{end_row}"
cell_range = f"{start_cell}:{end_cell}"

ws.merge_cells(cell_range)
cell = ws.cell(row=base_row, column=base_col)
cell.value = "STRATEGY CONFIGURATION:\n" + config_text
cell.alignment = Alignment(wrap_text=True, vertical="top")

# Optional: Set row heights for all spanned rows for readability
for r in range(base_row, end_row + 1):
    ws.row_dimensions[r].height = 25
```


***

**2. Remove Static/Frozen References to Merged Range**

If you have lines that say:

```python
ws.merge_cells('B5:F14')  # or similar, fixed merge range
```

**Delete/replace with dynamic code above.**

***

**3. Result**

- The merged cell is always large enough to display all config info, no matter how much text there is (unless user opens file in a broken viewer).
- If the config info increases, the code automatically expands the merged block vertically.
- Excel wraps the text, so multi-line config content will be visible.

***

**Summary**

- Calculate the `lines` (using `.count('\n')` or other measure).
- Use that to expand the merged cell *bottom row* (`end_row`).
- Set row heights for all spanned rows for better appearance.
- The config block remains in a merged, wrapped cell, never truncated.

***

**Apply this in VS Code (replace static merge/fixed ranges for strategy config).**
